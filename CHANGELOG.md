All notable changes to craftgo are documented here. The format is based on

[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — from 1.0.0 on, a
breaking change to the DSL or the generated layout bumps the major version.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-26

First stable release. craftgo turns a small `.craftgo` DSL into typed Go,
request validation, `net/http` handlers, route wiring, and an OpenAPI 3.1
spec — all from one source.

### DSL

- `type`, `scalar` (with validators that inherit to every field of that type),
  `enum` (string- and int-backed), and typed `error` categories.
- Generics (`Page<User>`), cross-package references (`import` + `pkg.Name`),
  and mixins (cross-package field composition).
- `service` blocks with `extend service` for splitting a service across files;
  per-block decorator inheritance with `@ignoreMiddleware` / `@ignoreSecurity`
  / `@ignoreTags` opt-outs.

### Validation

- Declarative validators compiled to plain Go `if` statements — no reflection,
  no runtime struct tags. `Validate()` is fail-fast.
- String: `@length`, `@minLength`, `@maxLength`, `@pattern`, `@format`.
- Numeric: `@gt`, `@gte`, `@lt`, `@lte`, `@range`, `@positive`, `@negative`,
  `@multipleOf`.
- Array: `@minItems`, `@maxItems`, `@uniqueItems`.
- File upload: `@maxSize`, `@mimeTypes`.
- Cross-field: `@requiresOneOf`, `@mutuallyExclusive`.

### Wire binding

- `@path`, `@query`, `@header`, `@cookie`, `@body`, `@form` — including
  cross-package scalar/enum casts and `@default` pre-fill.

### Codegen

- Typed structs + `Validate()`, per-method `net/http` handlers, route
  registration, gen-once service logic stubs, a `ServiceContext` container,
  and a wired `main.go`.
- OpenAPI 3.1 emitted from the same source, including `propertyNames` for map
  keys and `oneOf`/`anyOf` for cross-field constraints.
- Deterministic, gofmt-clean output; committed generated code is guarded by a
  regeneration drift check.

### Runtime (`pkg/`)

- `pkg/server`: a thin `net/http` wrapper — `*http.ServeMux`, a middleware
  `Chain`, a swappable JSON codec, health checks, CORS, and per-method timeout
  / body-size limits.
- `pkg/log`, `pkg/metrics`, `pkg/otel` for logging, metrics, and tracing.

### Tooling

- CLI: `craftgo init`, `craftgo gen`, `craftgo fmt`.
- Language server (`craftgo-lsp`) and a VS Code extension: completion, hover,
  go-to-definition, rename, live diagnostics, and formatting.
